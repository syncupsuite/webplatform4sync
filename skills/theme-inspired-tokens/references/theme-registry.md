## East Asia

### 1. Japan: Traditional (Nihon no Iro)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | `nihon-no-iro-traditional` |
| **Name** | Nihon no Dentou Iro (日本の伝統色) |
| **Story** | Rooted in the 465 traditional colors catalogued during Japan's Edo period, this palette draws from natural dye traditions -- indigo from the Tade-ai plant, red from safflower (beni), and earth tones from persimmon tannin (kakishibu). These colors were codified in the Meiji era as Japan formalized its aesthetic heritage. |
| **Philosophy** | Wabi-sabi (侘寂): beauty in imperfection and transience. Colors are muted, suggesting age and natural patina rather than synthetic vibrancy. |
| **Era** | Edo period (1603-1868), codified Meiji era (1868-1912) |

**Seed Colors**:

| Name | Native | Hex | Provenance |
|------|--------|-----|------------|
| Hanada | 縹 | `#2E4B6D` | Deep indigo from Tade-ai plant (Persicaria tinctoria), used in ai-zome dyeing since the 8th century. Reference: *Nihon no Dentou Iro* compendium. |
| Sakura-nezumi | 桜鼠 | `#B5A4A0` | Gray with a cherry-blossom tint, evoking fallen petals on stone. Popularized in Edo-period kimono design for its understated elegance. |
| Wasurenagusa-iro | 勿忘草色 | `#7BAACC` | Forget-me-not blue, a literary color from Heian-period poetry (waka). Lighter and more wistful than Hanada. |
| Kitsune-iro | 狐色 | `#C6A96C` | Fox color -- the warm gold-brown of a Japanese fox's coat. Used for autumn-themed textiles and lacquerware. |
| Enji | 臙脂 | `#9B3B47` | Deep crimson from the cochineal-adjacent beni (safflower) pigment. Status color in Heian court dress. |
| Rikyuu-nezumi | 利休鼠 | `#7A7D74` | A gray-green named after tea master Sen no Rikyu, embodying tea ceremony aesthetics -- restraint, natural harmony. |
| Shironeri | 白練 | `#F3ECDC` | Unbleached silk white. Not pure white but the warm off-white of natural silk before processing. |

**Suggested Harmony**: Monochromatic or Analogous (preserves the muted, cohesive quality of traditional palettes)

**Radius Tendency**: Sharp (none to sm) -- influenced by tatami mat geometry and shoji screen lines

---

### 2. Japan: Contemporary Minimalist

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | `japan-contemporary-minimal` |
| **Name** | Contemporary Japanese Minimalism |
| **Story** | Drawing from the post-war Japanese design movement that merged traditional aesthetics with modernist principles. Influenced by Naoto Fukasawa, Kenya Hara, and the MUJI design philosophy: "emptiness is not nothingness but infinite possibility." |
| **Philosophy** | Ma (間): the conscious use of negative space. Kanso (簡素): simplicity and elimination of the unnecessary. |
| **Era** | Late 20th century to present (1980s onward) |

**Seed Colors**:

| Name | Native | Hex | Provenance |
|------|--------|-----|------------|
| Sumi | 墨 | `#2C2C2C` | Ink-stone black -- not pure black but the warm charcoal of sumi ink, ground daily for calligraphy. |
| Shiro | 白 | `#F5F5F0` | Japanese white: warm and tactile, like washi paper. Distinct from sterile #FFFFFF. |
| Hai-iro | 灰色 | `#8E8E87` | Ash gray -- the color of incense ash in a zen garden. Neutral but alive. |
| Ai | 藍 | `#264D73` | Modern interpretation of traditional indigo. Slightly more saturated for screen legibility while preserving the cultural link to ai-zome. |
| Akane | 茜 | `#C0392B` | Madder red -- a single accent point of decisive color, used sparingly as Japanese design tradition dictates. |

**Suggested Harmony**: Golden Ratio (creates mathematical precision matching the modernist influence)

**Radius Tendency**: None (pure rectangles, zero radius -- the MUJI principle)

### 3. China: Tang Dynasty Imperial

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | `tang-dynasty-imperial` |
| **Name** | Tang Dynasty Palace Colors (唐朝宫廷色) |
| **Story** | The Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) was China's golden age of art and cosmopolitanism. Palace colors were codified in the *Yingzao Fashi* (building standards) and textile regulations, where color indicated rank and season. Mineral pigments -- cinnabar, azurite, malachite -- gave Tang art its distinctive vibrancy. |
| **Philosophy** | Wu Xing (五行): the five elements cycle (wood, fire, earth, metal, water) maps to five directional colors. Harmony through complementary forces. |
| **Era** | Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) |

**Seed Colors**:

| Name | Native | Hex | Provenance |
|------|--------|-----|------------|
| Zhu-sha | 朱砂 | `#CC3333` | Cinnabar vermillion -- the mineral pigment ground from mercury sulfide. Imperial red, used on palace columns, official seals, and celebratory documents. |
| Shi-qing | 石青 | `#2B5C8A` | Azurite blue -- mineral pigment from copper carbonate. Used in Tang Buddhist cave murals (Dunhuang). |
| Kong-que-lv | 孔雀绿 | `#2E7D5E` | Malachite green -- peacock green from copper carbonate. Associated with jade and imperial garden aesthetics. |
| Jin | 金 | `#D4A843` | Imperial gold -- the color of gilt bronze Buddhist statues and woven silk brocade. Not metallic but the warm tone of aged gold leaf. |
| Zi | 紫 | `#6B3A6B` | Tyrian-adjacent purple -- the rarest and most restricted color in Tang sumptuary laws, reserved for the highest officials. Derived from gromwell root (zi-cao). |
| Bai-yu | 白玉 | `#EDE8D8` | White jade -- the translucent warm white of hetian jade, prized above all gem materials in Chinese culture. |
| Mo | 墨 | `#1A1A2E` | Ink black with a blue undertone, from pine soot ink sticks used in calligraphy and painting. |

**Suggested Harmony**: Complementary or Triadic (reflects the bold, high-contrast Tang aesthetic)

**Radius Tendency**: Small (sm) -- rounded like Tang ceramic forms but not excessively soft

---

### 4. China: Modern Ink Wash

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | `china-modern-ink-wash` |
| **Name** | Contemporary Shui-Mo (现代水墨) |
| **Story** | Inspired by the modern ink wash painting movement that reinterprets traditional shanshui (mountain-water) landscape painting through contemporary eyes. Artists like Zhang Daqian and Wu Guanzhong bridge classical technique with modern abstraction. The palette is deliberately restrained, trusting the paper's white and ink's black to carry the composition. |
| **Philosophy** | Liu-bai (留白): the art of leaving white space. Meaning emerges from what is absent as much as what is present. |
| **Era** | Contemporary (1950s onward), rooted in Song Dynasty (960-1279) ink painting tradition |

**Seed Colors**:

| Name | Native | Hex | Provenance |
|------|--------|-----|------------|
| Nong-mo | 浓墨 | `#1C1C1E` | Dense ink -- the thickest concentration, nearly black but with warmth. First of the "five shades of ink" (wu-mo). |
| Dan-mo | 淡墨 | `#8C8C8B` | Light ink -- diluted to reveal the water's path. Creates atmosphere and depth. |
| Xuan-zhi | 宣纸 | `#F7F3EB` | Xuan paper white -- the absorbent rice paper that is as much a compositional element as the ink. |
| Zhu-yin | 朱印 | `#CC4444` | Seal red -- the only color in a monochrome ink painting. The artist's personal seal, stamped in cinnabar paste. |
| Qing-shan | 青山 | `#4A6670` | Blue-green mountain -- the teal of distant mountains in shanshui painting, where blue and green merge. |

**Suggested Harmony**: Monochromatic (primary palette is ink gradients with a single accent)

**Radius Tendency**: None to small -- follows calligraphic stroke discipline

## Europe

### 5. Switzerland: International Typographic Style

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | `swiss-international-style` |
| **Name** | Swiss International Typographic Style |
| **Story** | Developed in the 1950s at the Basel and Zurich schools of design, this movement established the grid system, asymmetric layouts, and objective photography as design principles. Max Miedinger's Helvetica (1957) and Josef Mueller-Brockmann's poster work define the visual language: clarity through mathematical order, color as information rather than decoration. |
| **Philosophy** | Sachlichkeit (objectivity): design serves communication. Color is functional, never decorative. Typography IS the design. |
| **Era** | 1950s-1970s, with lasting influence to present |

**Seed Colors**:

| Name | Native | Hex | Provenance |
|------|--------|-----|------------|
| Schwarz | Black | `#111111` | Near-black -- the primary color of Swiss typography. Text is always dark on light for maximum legibility. Slightly warm to avoid the harshness of #000000 on screens. |
| Weiss | White | `#FAFAFA` | Swiss white -- clean but not sterile. The gallery wall, the unprinted page, the grid's negative space. |
| Rot | Red | `#E8322E` | Swiss federal red, from the national flag. Used as a singular accent: one element, maximum impact. Derived from the 13th-century Schwyz cantonal banner. |
| Mittelgrau | Medium Gray | `#6E6E6E` | The workhorse neutral. Grid lines, secondary text, structural elements. Functional, not expressive. |
| Hellgrau | Light Gray | `#D4D4D4` | The lighter structural gray. Borders, dividers, backgrounds for code or data. |
| Dunkelblau | Dark Blue | `#1A3A5C` | Informational blue -- used for hyperlinks and interactive elements. Not decorative; borrowed from Swiss railway signage. |

**Suggested Harmony**: Monochromatic (black, white, gray) with a single Complementary accent (red)

**Radius Tendency**: None (pure geometry, no rounding -- the grid is rectangular)

### 6. Nordic: Scandinavian Modern

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | `nordic-scandinavian-modern` |
| **Name** | Scandinavian Modern (Nordisk Modernism) |
| **Story** | Emerged in the 1930s-1960s across Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Norway as a democratic response to industrial modernism. Where Bauhaus was machine-pure, Scandinavian design insists on warmth: natural materials, soft light, and humane proportions. Alvar Aalto's bent birch, Arne Jacobsen's organic chairs, and Marimekko's joyful patterns all share a belief that good design belongs to everyone, not just museums. |
| **Philosophy** | Hygge (Danish): coziness and togetherness. Lagom (Swedish): just the right amount. Design should feel like a warm room in a cold climate. |
| **Era** | 1930s-1960s, with continuous Nordic evolution to present |

**Seed Colors**:

| Name | Native | Hex | Provenance |
|------|--------|-----|------------|
| Bjork | Birch | `#E8DCC8` | Birch wood -- the defining material of Scandinavian furniture. Light, warm, and alive. From Finnish birch forests that supply Artek and Iittala. |
| Fjord | Fjord | `#4A7C8A` | Norwegian fjord water -- the cold teal of deep glacial inlets under overcast skies. Not tropical; this blue has weight and depth. |
| Lingon | Lingonberry | `#A63D40` | Lingonberry red -- the deep berry red found across Nordic cuisine and folk textiles. Warm but not aggressive. |
| Mos | Moss | `#6B7D5E` | Forest moss green -- the muted green of Scandinavian boreal forests. Grounded and organic, never synthetic. |
| Sno | Snow | `#F5F2ED` | Nordic snow white -- not blue-white but the warm white of snow at golden hour. The dominant "color" of Nordic interiors. |
| Gran | Spruce | `#2C3E3A` | Dark spruce -- the near-black green of Norwegian spruce forests in winter. Used for deep backgrounds and contrast. |
| Ull | Wool | `#B8AFA4` | Undyed wool gray -- the natural gray-brown of Norwegian sheep's wool before dyeing. Warm neutral. |

**Suggested Harmony**: Analogous (adjacent hues create the cohesive, enveloping warmth of Nordic interiors)

**Radius Tendency**: Medium (md to lg) -- organic curves inspired by Aalto's bent-wood forms

### 7. Italy: Renaissance Fresco

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | `italian-renaissance-fresco` |
| **Name** | Italian Renaissance Fresco Palette |
| **Story** | Drawn from the pigment palette of Italian fresco painters (1400-1550), particularly the Florentine masters -- Giotto, Fra Angelico, Botticelli, and Michelangelo. Fresco technique demands mineral pigments that bond with wet plaster: terre verte, raw sienna, lapis lazuli. The resulting colors have a chalky luminosity impossible with modern synthetic paint. These are colors born from the earth of Tuscany and traded across the Mediterranean. |
| **Philosophy** | Sprezzatura: the art of making the difficult appear effortless. Visual richness through carefully balanced complexity, never garish. |
| **Era** | Italian Renaissance (1400-1550), primarily Florentine and Roman schools |

**Seed Colors**:

| Name | Native | Hex | Provenance |
|------|--------|-----|------------|
| Terra di Siena | Sienna Earth | `#A0522D` | Raw sienna -- iron-oxide earth pigment from the hills near Siena. The warm brown foundation of every fresco underpainting. |
| Blu Oltremare | Ultramarine Blue | `#2B4B8C` | Ground lapis lazuli, imported from Afghanistan ("oltre mare" = beyond the sea). More expensive than gold, reserved for the Virgin Mary's mantle. |
| Rosso Corsa | Racing Red | `#CC2936` | Vermillion from cinnabar, the red of cardinal robes and Medici heraldry. Later became Italy's national racing color. |
| Terra Verde | Green Earth | `#4A7A5B` | Terre verte -- a clay pigment used for the green underlayer in flesh painting. Cool, muted, essential to fresco technique. |
| Oro | Gold | `#C9A84C` | Gold leaf -- not paint but hammered metal applied to halos and backgrounds. The divine made visible. |
| Bianco di San Giovanni | St. John's White | `#F0E6D2` | Lime white made from aged slaked lime, named after the Florence baptistery. The lightest value available to fresco painters. |

**Suggested Harmony**: Complementary (Renaissance masters deliberately paired warm/cool for dramatic depth)

**Radius Tendency**: Medium (md) -- arched forms inspired by Renaissance architecture (tondo, lunette, arch)

      "name": "color-name",
      "native": "native script if applicable",
      "hex": "#RRGGBB",
      "provenance": {
        "tradition": "The specific tradition or craft",
        "source": "Primary reference work or artifact"
      }
    }
  ],
  "harmonyMode": "golden-ratio",
  "radiusTendency": "md"
}
```

Every custom foundation must meet the same validation requirements as registered ones: minimum 5 seed colors, verifiable provenance, and a coherent narrative.
